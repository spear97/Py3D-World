# Py3D-World

## Description

This project serves to illustrate how to render a 3D-Textured, Environment Engine utlizing Python, OpenGL, and some GLSL. It is based off two projects two seperate projects. The first being StanislavPetrovV's [3D-Graphics-Engine Project](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/3D-Graphics-Engine) and the second being a prior project that I initially created for in my Computer Graphics Class at Texas Wesleyan Univerity for the Spring Semester of 2022. The purpose for developing this project is to act as two things:

1. To illustrate how Python can be used to render Computer Graphics for the Purposes of Simulation Programming
2. To act as a template for anyone to use in the future.
